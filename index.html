            <h2>Kenneth (Kenny) Epstein</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am Kenny, also known in some online spaces as KenEppy, Thrug, or
                Thrug0. I am a hobbiest programmer attempting to learn professionally
                by going to Iowa State University. I started College back in 2019, but
                due to COVID19, I was unable to continue until now, in Fall 2023
            </p>
            <p>
                I am incredibly busy, but also incredibly bored, so I may not be able to contact you in a
                timely matter, but I am always willing and happy to talk about whatever
                you want to. Please contact me at one of <a href="#contacts">these</a>
            </p>
